## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- Creating a new note now focuses the editor automatically. Thanks [@n00ki](https://github.com/n00ki)! [#278](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/278)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- [#282](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/282) Hubble now supports tabs! Works how you'd expect from Obsidian, Notion, or Google Chrome, with a horizontal tabbar and a set of familiar commands:
  - `cmd+t` opens the file palette to search for files or create a new note
  - `ctrl+t` and `ctrl+shift+t` walk through opened tabs
  - `cmd+shift+A` opens the "All Tabs" menu to see all tabs at a glance. Especially useful on narrow screens
- HTML Apps can open web links in the system browser and email links in the default email app, from plain `<a>` links or the new `hubble.links.open(url)` API. Thanks [@marcodlk](https://github.com/marcodlk)! [#274](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/274)
- Notes automatically lay out each block from right to left or left to right based on its text. Thanks [@n00ki](https://github.com/n00ki)! [#277](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/277)

### Changed

- The app window now appears about 200ms sooner on launch, already in the right theme, instead of staying hidden behind a bouncing dock icon until the whole app had loaded. Thanks [@zcuric](https://github.com/zcuric)! [#281](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/281)
- The desktop download is smaller: the app bundle dropped from 131 MB to 56 MB and the app code itself is half the size, so updates download faster. Thanks [@zcuric](https://github.com/zcuric)! [#281](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/281)

### Fixed

- Comment thread author headings and actions stay visible while long discussions scroll. Thanks [@LarrySequino](https://github.com/LarrySequino) for the suggestion! [#286](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/286)
- Typing and immediately opening another note no longer loses the last few characters. The open note is now saved before navigating rather than as the editor closes. [#282](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/282)
- Opening a Markdown file from Finder now brings Hubble to the front, and opens a window when the app is running with none open. Thanks [@HDPark95](https://github.com/HDPark95)! [#289](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/289)

## [0.1.28] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

### Fixed

- Sidebar keyboard focus stays on the same file or folder when sorting changes. [#267](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/267)

- Clicking elsewhere in a note now closes the formatting menu and clears its old text highlight. [#256](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/256)
- Pinned notes remain visible after restarting or updating the desktop app. [#254](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/254)

- Desktop controls adapt to narrow windows with an overlay sidebar and compact action menus. [#245](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/245)

### Fixed

- Sidebar rows now use one focus-aware highlight, so folders and open notes no longer appear selected at the same time. Thanks [@JoeJoeflyn](https://github.com/JoeJoeflyn)! [#235](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/235)
- Window controls now align with the app header on Windows and Linux. Thanks [@JoeJoeflyn](https://github.com/JoeJoeflyn)! [#236](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/236)

### Fixed

## [0.1.23] - 2026-07-29

- Leave review comments on a note: highlight text to start a thread, reply to it, and resolve it when it's handled. Comments live in the Markdown itself, so they travel with the file. Thanks [@hwong103](https://github.com/hwong103)! [#175](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/175)
- Browse every comment in a note from the toolbar, filter by unresolved or resolved, and copy a prompt handing the open threads to your agent. For the best results, install the [review-markdown-comments skill](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble-skills/blob/main/skills/review-markdown-comments/SKILL.md) with `npx skills add bholmesdev/hubble-skills --skill review-markdown-comments`, so your agent knows how to reply and resolve them. Thanks [@hwong103](https://github.com/hwong103)! [#175](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/pull/175)
